# Ansible Playbook for Docker Swarm and Portainer CE Deployment

This Ansible playbook automates the setup of a Docker Swarm cluster with a master node and worker nodes, and deploys Portainer CE on the Swarm cluster. This simplifies the process of creating and managing containerized applications in a production-ready environment.
